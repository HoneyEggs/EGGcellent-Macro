Other Info:
- Please do not delete or alter the images in the image folder.
- Do not download the files in the scripts folder. They will not work (Though I could make it work if people want to use them separately.)
- This macro is made mainly for people who don't know how to make a macro or an advanced one for themselves. You can edit the macro's code, but only if you know how to code.

How it works:
Auto-Spin
- This option will spin elements for you and stop at the selected rare+ element.
- It will assume that you are already at the spinner and will display an error message if you aren't.
- If you selected "Instant Spin" to be on, the macro will spam and check the spinner until the desired element is found.
- If you selected "Instant Spin" to be off, the macro will click the spin button and wait until the spinner is finished before checking the element.
- If you want, the macro can type in chat the element you got if you play on different devices or instances.

 Grind Levels
 - This option will use the best exp grinding method with the selected element to grind through levels as fast as possible. It will not stop grinding until you tell it to.
