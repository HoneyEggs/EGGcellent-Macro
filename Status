The Return
- Been a while, hasn't it?
- Another 1.5 years since the last update...
- So what happened this time?
- Well, for starters, I discovered that I have ADHD.
- The reason for my long breaks in the past was not because I burned myself out, but because every time I took a long break from this, I would keep putting this off for later and never get the motivation back.
- But my motivation to work on this macro has returned. Why? It's because I've been learning C#, a coding language.
- As I was learning, I always noticed the similarities AutoHotKey had with the C# coding language to the point where I basically already knew C# by complete accident.
- This, paired with the motivation to code something, has led me to come back to this yet again.
- I was always frustrated when the macro refused to work for people, even though it worked for me, but looking through the macro's code, I could already spot the mistakes in there.
- So, as the first update to my return, I'll be rewriting the code to fix all mistakes and to make it fit with the universal coding standard. It won't be a complete rewrite like the first one (mainly because I'm actually proud of how past me organized the code), but
  there will be a lot of changes to it.
- After that, I'll get to adding any new elements that have come to this game while I was gone.
- And about AHK v2, I'll get to that, but after the macro is finished. It will be easier that way.
- So, to the remaining 20 people who still play this game, EGGcellent Macro is back on the menu.

Break.
- Hi.
- It's been a while since I last did anything
- Where have I been? Pursuing my music career (and by that I mean struggling to make one good song)
- But now I'm back again with some news
- After some short reconsideration, I have decided not to update the macro to AHKv2 for 3 main reasons:
1. It will take too long
2. AHKv2 is harder to work with than AHKv1.1
3. I don't really need to update it. v1.1 works just fine.
- So with that out of the way, I will now be resuming my work on the EGGcellent Macro.
- The next thing to work on would be auto-spinning.

AHK v2
- As I was about to start on the "Auto-Spin" mode, I discovered that AHK had made v2 its official version now.
- This means that v1.1, which is what this macro was made using, won't be getting updates anymore.
- So I've decided to convert this macro to v2.
- Unfortunately, this means I have to rewrite the code...again.
- It shouldn't take too long, though.
- As I am writing this, I have already finished most of the GUI.
- After I finish the GUI and make it do stuff, I can just copy and paste the macro over.
- That is all.

Cured.
- I'm better now! :D

Sickness.
- Right as I was about to work on the "Auto-Level" subtab, I discovered that I was sick.
- Therefore, no macro updates for a while.
- But at least I will get an excusable break so I don't accidentally burn myself out again.

Progress Report #2
- Hello again.
- The new GUI for the macro has been finished
- I also moved everything into 1 single tab, except for the credits
- Unfortunately, I will have to disable all modes since they aren't finished.
- I will release the first beta so you can get used to the new GUI while I work on the first mode.
- I was originally going to do the "Grind Spins" mode first, but I've instead decided to do the "Auto-Level mode first.
- This shouldn't take too long, so stay tuned for the next beta release!
- That is all. Goodbye.

Progress Report #1
- Hello!
- I have finished the first tab of the macro.
- This means that the new macro is 25% done!
- The way this macro is structured is that all of the selections and modes are shoved into 1 single tab that has 3 custom subtabs for the 3 modes, while the modifications will be on their tab.
- This is so that the GUI looks cleaner.
- I'm also going to re-enable the spin grinder and fix it.
- And that's all I have to say! See you next report!

I'm back.
- Hi! So you might have been wondering where I have been these past 10 months, and well, uhhhhhhhhh.........I might have accidentally burned myself out.
- I got too excited that people were using my macro, that it was getting a lot of recognition, and that people were saying that it was good and giving feedback, so I wouldn't stop working on it.
- This led to the consequence of me not having any motivation to work on this macro, and I didn't regain the motivation until now.
- So now I'm back and I have a lot of plans.
- First, I want to finish the auto-level grinder so that people can grind levels in the best way possible with the selected element.
- Then, I want to reorganize my code because it is still a big mess.
- I also want to disable the spin grinder, as that needs much more testing for it to work fully.
- I will probably restart the code from scratch, but it shouldn't take too long, as I will just copy and paste most of the code from the original macro, but will alter it to make it more readable.
- I'll also be learning new techniques to improve the macro overall.
- But yeah...That's all I have to say, so see you!
