- Hi! So you might have been wondering where I have been these past 10 months and well uhhhhhhhhh.........I might have accidentally burned myself out.
- I got too excited with the fact that people were actually using my macro and that it was getting a lot of recognition and that people were saying that it was good and giving feedback on it that I wouldn't stop working on it.
- This led to the consequence of me not having any motivation to work on this macro and I didn't regain the motivation until now.
- So now I'm back and I have a lot of plans.
- First, I want to finish the auto level grinder so that people can grind levels in the best way possible with the selected element.
- Then, I want to reorganize my code because it is still a big mess.
- I also want to disable the spin grinder as that needs a lot of more testing for it to fully work.
- I'm probably going to restart the code from scrach, but it shouldn't take too long as I will just copy and paste most of the code from the original macro, but will alter it to make it more readable.
- I'll also be learning new techniques to improve the macro overall.
- But yea...Thats all I have to say so see ya!
