AHK v2
- As I was about to start on the "Auto-Spin" mode, I discovered that AHK had made v2 its official version now.
- This means that v1.1, which is what this macro was made using, won't be getting updates anymore.
- So I've decided to convert this macro to v2.
- Unfortunately, this means I have to rewrite the code...again.
- It shouldn't take too long though.
- As I am writing this, I have already finished most of the GUI.
- After I finish the GUI and make it do stuff, I can just copy and paste the macro over.
- That is all.

Cured.
- I'm better now! :D

Sickness.
- Right as I was about to work on the "Auto-Level" subtab, I discovered that I was sick.
- Therefore, no macro updates for a while.
- But at least I will get an excusable break so I don't accidentally burn myself out again.

Progress Report #2
- Hello again.
- The new GUI for the macro has been finished
- I also moved everything into 1 single tab except for the credits
- Unfortunately, I will have to disable all modes since they aren't finished.
- I will release the first beta so you can get used to the new GUI while I work on the first mode.
- I was originally going to do the "Grind Spins" mode first, but I've instead decided to do the "Auto-Level mode first.
- This shouldn't take too long, so stay tuned for the next beta release!
- That is all. Goodbye.

Progress Report #1
- Hello!
- I have finished the first tab of the macro.
- This means that the new macro is 25% done!
- The way this macro is structured is that all of the selections and modes are shoved into 1 single tab that has 3 custom subtabs for the 3 modes while the modifications will be on their tab.
- This is so that the GUI looks cleaner.
- I'm also going to re-enable the spin grinder and fix it.
- And that's all I have to say! See you next report!

I'm back.
- Hi! So you might have been wondering where I have been these past 10 months and well uhhhhhhhhh.........I might have accidentally burned myself out.
- I got too excited that people were using my macro, that it was getting a lot of recognition, and that people were saying that it was good and giving feedback that I wouldn't stop working on it.
- This led to the consequence of me not having any motivation to work on this macro and I didn't regain the motivation until now.
- So now I'm back and I have a lot of plans.
- First, I want to finish the auto-level grinder so that people can grind levels in the best way possible with the selected element.
- Then, I want to reorganize my code because it is still a big mess.
- I also want to disable the spin grinder as that needs much more testing for it to work fully.
- I will probably restart the code from Scrach, but it shouldn't take too long as I will just copy and paste most of the code from the original macro, but will alter it to make it more readable.
- I'll also be learning new techniques to improve the macro overall.
- But yeah...That's all I have to say so see you!
