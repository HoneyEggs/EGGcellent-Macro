Grinding spins
- The macro will spam use moves 1 and 2 to level up until level 9
- Then, it will go to spin.
- It will spin once (if you accidently have keep level on, it will turn it off for you) to reset you level.
- Depending on what you selected, the macro will stop if it encounters the specific element(s)
- This will repeat forever until stopped.

Auto-Spin
- The macro imeediately goes to spin for an element
- However, it will not turn on or off Keep Level for you
- It will keep spinning until you run out of spins, or if it encounters the selected element(s)
