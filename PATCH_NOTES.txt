[v2.0 Beta b] - The Rework Update: Auto-Level
Additions
- Finished and enabled the "Auto-Level" mode.

Fixes
- Pausing and playing actually works now.

[v2.0 Beta a] - The Rework Update: GUI
Additions
- New "Auto-Level" mode which allows you to level up automatically with the best method possible for the selected element.
- Added "Dragon Blade" and "Spectre" into the Myths section.
- You can now spin for Common, Uncommon, and Ascended elements.
- New buttons at the bottom to control the macro instead of just hotkeys.
- The new GUI-making style makes the GUI look much better than the last style I went with.

Changes
- The ENTIRE macro's code has been rewritten because of how much of a mess it was.
- Combined all modes and selections into a tab called "Modes".
- Moved all modes into custom subtabs that you can select.
- The macro will now tell you what mode you're on at the bottom of the GUI and will give info on that mode if necessary.
- Renamed the spin mode into "Auto-Spin" to clarify what it does and to distinguish it from the "Grind Spins" mode.
- Combined all of the scattered settings across different tabs into a single section called "Settings" in the "Modes" Tab.

Other
- Due to how massive this update is, I've decided to skip to version 2.0 instead of v1.8.
- Currently, only the GUI is completed. The other modes have been disabled.
